The More Levels Bludit Plugin allows you to select all available pages as parent, by bypassing and
overwriting the default AJAX function. A few lines of JavaScript also ensures, that you can easily
edit each page, without loosing the parent page again. The plugin also injects a custom `Pages`
class to get easily access to the parent pages too. Next to them it also fixed a known [issue](https://github.com/bludit/bludit/issues/777)!
